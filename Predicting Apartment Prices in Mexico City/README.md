# Predicting Apartment Prices in Mexico City ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½

This data science and analysis project aims to predict apartment prices in Mexico City. The project utilizes various Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

Libraries used:
- **glob**: For file handling and retrieving file names.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: For creating static visualizations like histograms and scatter plots.
- **plotly.express**: For interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **category_encoders**: For encoding categorical variables.
- **sklearn**: For machine learning tasks such as data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Tasks performed:

1. **Wrangle Function**: A function is created to preprocess the data, including filtering apartments in Mexico City, removing outliers, creating new columns for latitude and longitude, creating a borough feature, handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and addressing potential issues like leakage and multicollinearity.

2. **File List**: Used glob to create a list of files.

3. **Histogram**: Created a histogram to visualize the distribution of apartment prices.
