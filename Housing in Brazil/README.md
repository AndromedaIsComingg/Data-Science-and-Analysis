## Data Preparation and Cleaning

The dataset comprises two distinct files, each requiring individual treatment before concatenation into a unified dataset. Several preprocessing steps were undertaken, including the removal of empty rows, the creation of new columns to enhance analysis, and the elimination of columns with irrelevant or inappropriate data. Additionally, a currency conversion was implemented to standardize pricing in USD for enhanced comparability.
